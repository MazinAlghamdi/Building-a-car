# Building-a-car
In this project we are going to build two types of different cars there are two classes one for BMW and the other for Chevrolet each class will specify its specialty. 
in the main class we created two objects for each type of car (BMW and Chevrolet) so BMW we create an object using Car class and another one for BMW class,The first object used to
specify which car is it and to build it afterwords it will be painted,The second object will tell you the type of the vehicle then it will builds the parts of the vehicle which is Body,power,engine,seats,windows,fuel type.
We created an interface which is called Carbuilder that has all the parts in methods and each method is created in its own class,These methods are implemented in the BMW class afterwords the information of all these parts of the vehicle will be created.
Lastly the program will call a method from class Carinfo the name of the method getCar this method will print out the information of the car that the program built.
The second car will go through the same process but the information and parts are different also the it will not change anything from the first car which is the BMW
